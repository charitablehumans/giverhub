    Bet-a-Friend is a fun new way for people to settle arguments and contribute to their favorite charities at the same time.</p>
<p class="vegur_regular bet-a-friend-text lead">At no point will either participant be forced to donate.</p>
<p class="lead vegur_light bet-a-friend-text">You or your friend set the terms of the bet, including a date when the winner will be determined. We recommend being very specific when drafting your terms so that determining a winner is not open to debate.</p>
<p class="lead vegur_light bet-a-friend-text">When the time comes to select a winner, GiverHub will walk you through the process and the loser will be prompted to make the agreed upon donation to the winner's nonprofit of choice.</p>
<p class="lead vegur_regular bet-a-friend-text">As of now there will be no penalty for refusing to make the agreed upon donation.</p>
